If you remember that Mr. Sherlock Hills has been practicing his practice for twenty-three years, and of these, I have had 17 years to cooperate with him and keep records of his cases, it will become clear that I have a lot of material. The task has always been not to seek, but to choose . The entire shelf is occupied with annual records, there are folders full of documents — indeed, a treasure for anyone who studies not only crime, but all sorts of social and public events that have made noise at the end of the Victorian era.
An entire shelf is occupied by notes with annual records, and there are folders full of documents — indeed a treasure for anyone who studies not only crime, but a variety of social and public events that make noise at the end of the Victorian era. With regard to the latter, I can tell you that the authors of disturbing letters begging for mercy on the honor of their family or the glorious name of their famous ancestors have nothing to fear.
With regard to the latter, I can say that the authors of the disturbing letters, begging for the mercy of their family or the glorious name of their famous ancestors, have nothing to fear. The caution and the high consciousness of professional duty, who have always distinguished my friend, remain valid in the selection of these notes, and no one's trust will be deceived.
The discretion and the high consciousness of professional duty that have always characterized my friend remain valid in the selection of these notes, and no one's trust will be deceived. And I strongly condemn recent attempts to destroy these papers. . . who is behind all this. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Who is behind all this is known, and if attempts are repeated, with Mr. Hills' permission, I will make public all information about a certain policy, a lighthouse, and a trained bucklanc . At least one reader will understand me. naively, it would seem that, in all cases without exception, the hill was able to display an amazing gift of sense and observation that I was trying to capture in my notes.
It would be naive to believe that, in all cases without exception, the hill was able to display the amazing gift of sense and observation that I tried to see in my notes. Sometimes it had to do a lot of work to disrupt the fruit, and sometimes the fruit itself fell into the hands. Often the worst human tragedies gave the hill the least chance of showing its talents, one such story I want to tell.

I only slightly changed the name and place of action, otherwise I'm telling you exactly . One day at the end of 1896 I received a note from the hill asking it to arrive in haste.
One day at the end of 1896, I received a note from the hill asking him to arrive in haste. When I arrived, I found him in a room full of tobacco smoke; in a chair opposite the owner, there was a gentleman, a healthy woman, who usually rented rooms with a boarding house.
